Start Package to play the game HelloMirrorDroneMulti

Hey if you are here, it means that you want to learn code by having fun playing in drone eSport game :)

Welcome to you.

I am going to design some tutorial in the future.
But for now, I am just providing some starter pack.
To push and read bytes from the game client.

To play, two ways: 
- Download the client of the game: https://github.com/EloiStree/2024_06_01_HelloMirrorDroneMulti/releases/
  - Easy to use
  - You have a visual of the game but it takes GPU and CPU resources 
- Use RSA WII WS and a RSA Broadcast Listener WS: Done but incoming tutorial.
  - Hard to use (but useful after the workshop) 
  - Work on any computer without client and so without visual
